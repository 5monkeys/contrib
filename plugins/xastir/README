Be sure to correctly edit the STATION_CALL, XASTIRDIR, and LOGDIR variables

STATION_CALL: The callsign used by Xastir (include suffix if one is in use)
XASTIRDIR: The directory where Xastir's data, config, etc files are found.  Typically ~/.xastir
LOGDIR:  Logs are typically stored in ~/.xastir/logs.  Ensure that permissions are set appropriately to allow the munin user to read these logs
